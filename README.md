# Marquee-Scroller
A Basic Java Marquee Scroller

This program is a basic version of a Marquee Program i am currently developing.

 > This program was built using Java 19. This program is still in development and does not have an official release. It does work in its current
 form to use a basic marquee scroller. It can be cloned and used via linux console or from your IDE with some configureation.
 
 *I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED FROM THIS PROGRAM, IT IS STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT, USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.*

This program uses code from **Rob Camick** sourced from *https://tips4java.wordpress.com/2011/04/24/marquee-panel/*

 > This code is used in the MarqueePanel.java file to create the main marquee effect accross the program frame.
  
This is a program made for a family member to use while streaming.

**I DO NOT CLAIM ANY OWNERSHIP OVER ANY CODE USED WITHIN THE *MarqueePanel.java* FILE. ALL OTHER CODE WAS WRITTEN BY ME.**
